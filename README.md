END-USER FEATURES
Console Options: 
Provide a user-friendly console with options:

* 70-60, D: 60-50, F: 50 below).

Note: Implement an appropriate structure for the student, and records must be
stored in a file-based system.

Bonus/ Optional Tasks:

the average percentage of students in a specified class.
2. Calculate Average Marks of a Student: Implement a feature to calculate and
display the average marks of a specific student.

I have tried to implement almost all the use cases as mentioned. Also I've used the file-based data storing system "CSV File".
I have used flask module of Python to build it as an app.
